Installation
============

GECo is installed like any other Python module:

    [sudo -H] pip install [--upgrade] .

Alternatively, if you want to run a code against GECo without
installing it, enter the GECo directory (this directory) and
run the following command:

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH

Dependencies
------------

GECo depends on FEniCS version 2017.2.0.
